Due to the rainfall in the past season and deep soils in the area, the gully has expanded causing rampant erosion in the area. Therefore, the purpose of the solution is to solve the challenges of erosion.   ACDP development with the support of UNDP revealed the challenges of SLM issues as the main ones. The solution was a result of the needs identified as part of the Chiefdom development process.  This was the biggest danger which needed machinery as the problem is a result of poor drainage.  The focus here was also aimed for skills transfer as the project involves local labour from the community. The aim is to also fence the place for environmental benefits such as planting of fruit trees and grass to create the necessary ground cover to prevent further erosion.  \n",

      "It is currently at testing phase and has been used by the user for about 5 years now with success\n",
      "\n",
      "So far the solution has so far been by one homestead, but the plan was to diffuse it to one other community when COVID 19 hit and all plans were halted. The solution has received positive feedback from the user as she has been using it consistently for the past 5 years. it has reduced the need for her to collect fuel wood as she lives alone and can nolonger walk long distances. \n",
      "\n",
      "No calculations to estimate this have been undertaken. However, 75% of Swazis in rural areas are dependent of wood energy for cooking, and this technology, if widely diffused, can result in major reduction in the dependence on wood fuel use. the costs saved would not only be in monetary terms but would have to take into account the time savings for women, who often have to walk long distances and spend hours collecting this energy source.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The are no known cross border bottlenecks that can affect the diffusion of this solution. However, locally, one organization (The Renewable Energy Association of Eswatini) that has tried to pilot the solution on a larger scale has reported some challenges in doing so. These include the non-availability of a local expert to test the safety of the equipment that was installed as well as the tedious nature of the feedstock (cow dung) that has to go into the digester. at an individual level, the cost of installing the digester does not justify the end result especially for the poor who are currently dependant on a \"free\" energy source (wood). as such, without the intervention of an external partner, the diffusion of this solution would be a challenge\n",
