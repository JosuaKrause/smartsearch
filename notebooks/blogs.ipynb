      "=TEXT==================\n",
      "UNDP Bahrain, in partnership with the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs, is excited to announce the sixth edition of the Youth Leadership Programme (YLP) in the year 2020. This article contains all you need to know about YLP6 and how to be part of it!\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the Youth Leadership Programme?\n",
      "The YLP is an initiative under the UNDP Regional Bureau for Arab States, launched in 2015 to build the region's most dynamic network working at the intersection of youth, innovation and sustainable development. The programme aims to empower a generation of young leaders, changemakers, and social innovators, to grow their capacity in tackling the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in their countries and the Arab region.\n",
      "YLP has run five successful cycles and, as of end of 2019, has worked with over 20,000 youth participants and supported 7,000+ projects. YLP participants have launched and established successful small businesses, won municipality elections, received recognition and awards for their innovative solutions, and presented their ideas at renowned universities and global platforms like the ECOSOC Youth Forum within the UN Headquarters in New York, Stanford University, Hult International Business School, and the European Parliament.\n",
      "\n",
      "YLP is built on three core pillars:\n",
      "Bahrain UNDP country office joined the Youth Leadership Programme in its third edition (YLP3). Since then, and through working with the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs and local youth-serving organizations, we have slowly shaped the YLP experience in Bahrain.\n",
      "Every country in the Arab region does YLP slightly differently, and in Bahrain, we worked closely with our partners to unlock the potential of young people in Bahrain and foster their active role in achieving the SDGs. We did this by developing our YLP participants' social innovation ideas through facilitating dynamic workshops and inviting inspiring speakers. The young participants would create groups that focus on a strong idea and work together to present it to a local judging committee, where the winners would then join the YLP Regional Forum to present their ideas and connect with other young social innovators across the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "2020 is a remarkable year in many ways. Unforeseen changes have happened in our societies due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, changing the ways we are working together and socializing. Staying at home and social distancing have become part of our everyday life.\n",
      "We believe that young people can be in the forefront in responding to pandemics and in supporting the recovery of their communities and societies. Many are already active as health workers and community leaders, whereas others are developing innovative solutions to support vulnerable populations or building low-cost health devices such as face masks.\n",
      "However, in the middle of the immediate response, we need to keep the long-term development challenges in mind. The COVID-19 pandemic affects our ability to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, yet its creating an opportunity for building our communities back better.\n",
      "In 2020, with a Decade of Action to achieve the UN’s 2030 Agenda, YLP6 is looking closely at Three Key Topics:\n",
      "Climate Change (SDG13) is one of the most complex and pressing issues we are facing as a global community. The climate has always gone through changes in the past, only today it is in rapid change, that is making it harder for human communities to adapt to an increase in global temperature (as we can feel here in the Gulf), a rise in sea levels, and the sharp degradation of nature’s ecosystems that our human civilizations rely on.\n",
      "Climate Action means to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, reverse ecological degradation, mitigate adverse environmental changes, and develop resilient and adaptive strategies for a changing climate.\n",
      "SDG16 is dedicated to the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, the provision of access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable institutions at all levels.\n",
      "Civic Engagement means to be involved in making a difference in the civic life of your community, through engaging with national strategies, policies, and implementation. We believe that to achieve change, youth need to actively engage in the national dialogue in Bahrain, to share their voice and be part of policy development.\n",
      "COVID-19 has suddenly exposed fundamental weaknesses in our global system. It has shown beyond doubt how the prevalence of poverty, weak health systems, lack of education, and above all sub-optimal global cooperation, is exacerbating the crisis. Achieving the SDGs will put us on a solid foundation and a firm path to dealing with global health risks and emerging infectious diseases.\n",
      "Tackling Pandemics means to strengthen our health response systems, developing effective collaboration strategies, and building back better to prevent future infectious disease outbreaks.\n",
      "Guided by our exploration of these topics, we are going further in developing Bahrain’s youth capacity in personal development, self-awareness, critical thinking, collaborative leadership, and holistic problem-solving to tackle the challenges we face here in Bahrain and in the Arab region. YLP6 will be focusing on expanding and learning from young people’s perspective and mindset on the world, and creating a space for their creative ideas to grow and thrive. \n",
      "Our YLP6 Objectives\n",
      "YLP6 Bahrain is developed and implemented through the collaboration with and support of the YLP regional team, located in Amman.\n",
      "This year’s YLP6 is planned and implemented through a close collaboration of the National Committee: A team of young representatives from UNDP Bahrain, the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs, Ayadi Relief, Rotaract Club of Bahrain, AIESEC Bahrain, Global Shapers Manama Hub, and YLP5 Alumni,\n",
      "Join our YLP6 Journey\n",
      "We are inviting Bahrain’s youth to join our YLP6 journey this year!\n",
      "The programme will consist of two main parts. The YLP6 Experience stage and the Teams Mentorship stage. Each stage ends with an event, the SDGs Challenge and the YLP6 Regional Forum (respectively). The third stage of Reflections will bring the participants back together to share and give feedback on their YLP6 experience.\n",
      "The year at a glance:\n",
      "YLP6 Experience\n",
      "After selecting successful applicants to join YLP6, the main experience starts mid July, The series of workshops will include:\n",
      "SDGs Challenge\n",
      "By the end of the YLP6 Experience, participants will have grouped together in teams, focusing on developing their social innovation idea. The teams will then present their ideas to a judging panel at the SDGs Challenge event. The winning teams will proceed to the next stage.\n",
      "Teams Mentorship\n",
      "Once we select the winning teams, we will further develop the capacity of the participants and mature their idea in the Teams Mentorship stage, This will include:\n",
      "YLP6 Regional Forum\n",
      "Every year, the YLP ends with a regional forum where successful youth participants travel to a hosting Arab country. YLP participants get to meet youth from all around the Arab region, share knowledge, learn from each others’ ideas, and network with other young people, regional social innovation experts and policy leaders, and international development organizations. The format and date of the Regional Forum will be defined at a later time, depending on the COVID-19 situation in the region.\n",
      "Reflections\n",
      "It is important to understand the real impact of the YLP6 on the participants, and create a space where we can share our experience of the programme. During this stage, all YLP6 participants will come together to reflect on their learnings, share their feedback, how to keep connected, and how to continue to work together on achieving the Agenda 2030.\n",

      "=TEXT==================\n",
      "In partnership with the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs, UNDP Bahrain is announcing the eighth edition of the Youth Leadership Programme (YLP8) for the year 2022!\n",
      "The Youth Leadership Programme (YLP) is a UNDP regional programme for the Arab countries that was launched in 2015. The programme purpose is to build the region’s most dynamic network working at the intersection of youth, innovation, and sustainable development. The programme aims to empower a generation of young leaders, changemakers, and social innovators, to grow their capacity in tackling the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in their countries and the Arab region.\n",
      "YLP has run seven successful cycles to date and, as of the end of 2021, has worked with over 30,000 youth participants. YLP participants have launched and established successful small businesses, won municipality elections, received recognition and awards for their innovative solutions, and presented their ideas at renowned universities and global platforms like the ECOSOC Youth Forum within the UN Headquarters in New York, Stanford University, Hult International Business School, and the European Parliament.\n",
      "Over the past 7 years, UNDP in partnership with local governments and youth-serving organizations (YSOs), has been working to train and build the capacity of youth to enable them to be the drivers of development and progress in their communities. UNDP Bahrain country office joined the Youth Leadership Programme in its third edition (YLP3). Since then, and through working with the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs, local youth-serving organizations, and the YLP Bahrain Community (consisting of YLP alumni, facilitators, and speakers), the YLP Experience has been continuously shaped to deliver the best sustainable development leadership training in Bahrain.\n",
      "The YLP in Bahrain was fully virtual for the last two years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, giving the programme team and youth an opportunity to experience new ways of learning. Taking those learnings on, the new YLP8 will have a hybrid format, with the core workshops done in-person and working sessions done virtually.\n",
      "The YLP8 is planned and implemented through a close collaboration of the YLP8 National Committee which consists of a team of young representatives from UNDP Bahrain office, the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs, AlMabarrah AlKhalifia Foundation, Ayadi Relief, AIESEC Bahrain, Global Shapers Manama Hub, and YLP alumni. YLP sponsors; Abdulrahim Alkooheji Foundation continue their support in building youth’ capacity as agents of change in promoting sustainable development.\n",
      "Transforming the future of young people through quality education and gender equality\n",
      "This year, the YLP8 overarching theme will focus on access to quality education (SDG4) and gender equality (SDG5) as a means of transforming the future of work and young men and women in the Arab region.\n",
      "Quality, comprehensive, inclusive, and adequate education is key to socio-economic mobility, escaping poverty and having access to decent employment. According to the International Labour Organization, youth unemployment in the Arab States is the fastest growing in the world, increasing from 19.5 to 25.6 percent between 2012 and 2020. Access to learning and skilling is vital for transition into decent work and economic growth. It is key for the youth, both men and women, to have transferable and adequate skills that meet the demands of the modern labour market and how those would change in the years ahead, including, but not limited to, communications skills, digital literacy, financial literacy, critical thinking, and creative and innovative mindset that are viewed through a Future of Work (FoW) lens.\n",
      "The covid-19 pandemic, protracted conflict and civil unrest in the region has disrupted learning of many young people, hindering their employment prospects and thus transition into adulthood. Especially affected are young women in the region, who face additional challenges and barriers in accessing education and decent employment comparing to men, such as discrimination, patriarchal gender norms perceiving specific profession as unfit for women and expecting women to take on primary caregiver roles. Supporting women is a priority in this region for a number of cross-cutting reasons, however supporting their access to quality education leads to both decent work and financial stability, which is a key element in achieving gender equality.\n",
      "YLP8 will therefore drive national and regional discussions with youth on how to address challenges through social innovation and create sustainable and inclusive solutions.\n",
      "The YLP8 in Bahrain this year aims to achieve the following objectives:\n",
      "\n",
      "The programme will focus on exploring innovation in our ways of learning and how life-long learning can create a sustainable and thriving future of work for all people, while ensuring the closing of the gender gap across academic and professional spaces across our communities.\n",
      "By joining the programme, participants will:\n",
      "\n",
      "After selecting successful applicants to join YLP8 Experience, the programme will starting the last week of September and continue until end of October. While participants join as individuals, halfway through the programme, participants will form teams that work together in identifying their challenge area and creating an innovative solution that contributes to the achievement of the SDGs in Bahrain and beyond.\n",
      "The programme will consist of a series of intensive in-person weekend workshops and virtual working sessions for 5 weeks, followed by a week for reflection and closing, that will take participants on the following journey:\n",
      "At the end of the YLP8 Experience, the teams will then present their ideas to a judging panel at the SDGs Challenge final event. Three winning teams will proceed to the Mentorship stage and have the opportunity to join the YLP8 Regional Forum!\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the three winning teams are selected, they are further supported to develop their capacity and mature their ideas in the Teams Mentorship stage. This will include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Every year, the YLP ends with a regional forum where successful youth participants from 18 participating countries travel to a hosting Arab country. YLP participants get to meet youth from all around the Arab region, share knowledge, learn from each other’s ideas, and network with other young people, regional social innovation experts and policy leaders, and international development organizations.

      "\n",
      "What is the Youth Leadership Programme?\n",
      "The YLP is an initiative under the UNDP Regional Bureau for Arab States, launched in 2015 to build the region's most dynamic network working at the intersection of youth, innovation and sustainable development. The programme aims to empower a generation of young leaders, changemakers, and social innovators, to grow their capacity in tackling the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in their countries and the Arab region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Youth Leadership Programme: Past, Present and Future\n",
      "Over the last 6 years, UNDP in partnership with Youth-Serving Organizations (YSOs) has been working, training, building the capacity of youth to enable them to be the drivers of development and progress in their countries and communities. Generalized training have been delivered ranging from the introduction training in the Sustainable Development Goals, Gender Equality and Equity sensitization to Social Innovation. Design Thinking has been used as a methodology to support young people create solutions to problems, they are most passionate about. These past 6 years have demonstrated the creativity, agility, and eagerness of young people to support the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in the region as partners. With less than a decade left to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is vital that youth are empowered partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNDP Bahrain country office joined the Youth Leadership Programme in its third edition (YLP3). Since then, and through working with the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs, local youth-serving organizations, and the YLP Bahrain Community (consisting of YLP alumni, facilitators, and speakers), the YLP Experience has collaboratively and steadily been shaped in Bahrain.\n",
      "Every country in the Arab region does YLP slightly differently based on the local context and needs, and in Bahrain, UNDP Bahrain works closely with its partners to unlock the potential of young people in Bahrain and foster their active role in achieving the SDGs. The YLP6 team did this last year by developing the YLP participants' social innovation ideas through facilitating virtual dynamic workshops and inviting inspiring speakers. The young participants then created groups that focus on a strong social innovation idea and worked together to present it to a local judging committee, where the winners then joined the YLP Regional Forum to present their ideas and connect with other young social innovators across the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young men and women have the potential to drive significant change and promote the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, they face several challenges making it difficult for them to reach their potential as changemakers.\n",
      "Changemakers can be defined as young people striving to make a positive impact on their communities by implementing a community-based project, being active in shaping national policies that support their communities and country and running social enterprises that create jobs while addressing a social issue.\n",
      "Youth in the Arab region are born into and up against complex realities that make their roles as changemakers all the more challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic and its stressors in the Arab region are set against a backdrop of protracted crises and instability, of poverty and famine, of discrimination and exclusion, of high unemployment and economic collapse. In many cases, these realities have perpetuated for generations, so that the traumas experienced by youth today are woven with the generational trauma they carry from decades of stress and tension.\n",
      "The context in which youth in the Arab region are coming of age cannot be controlled; but to the best of the UNDP’s ability, its role is to support youth’s desire and commitment to implement positive change. In addition to the technical skills required to advance their change-making ideas, young people need to be equipped with tools to cope with stress and to ride the waves of unpredictable circumstances.\n",
      "Under the title of “Creating Change from Inside Out,” The YLP7 will focus on the topics of Wellbeing and Mental Health, engaging and discussing the reality and challenges in Bahrain with the interconnection of individual, community and planetary wellbeing, and how addressing all levels of wellbeing could galvanize the achievement of the SDGs.\n",
      "We ask how can wellbeing be at the center of tackling all the SDGs challenges? How can changemakers create effective positive change when they address their mental health? What does community and planetary wellbeing mean, and how can we work towards it?\n",
      "\n",
      "The YLP7 is planned and implemented through a close collaboration of the YLP7 National Committee: A team of young representatives from UNDP Bahrain, the Ministry of Youth and Sport Affairs, AlMabarrah AlKhalifia Foundation, Ayadi Relief, Rotaract Club of Bahrain, AIESEC Bahrain, Global Shapers Manama Hub, and YLP alumni.\n",
      "The YLP7 National Committee has come together this year to look at the theme of “Creating Change from Insight Out,” focusing on Wellbeing and how it relates to Bahrain. Through a collaborative effort, the National Committee has identified the following objectives:\n",
      "The YLP7 Experience is a 10-week learning journey that aims to build the inner, interpersonal, and professional capacity of young women and men to create social and environmental impact in their communities and the world. Taking on the theme of “Creating Change from Inside Out,” the YLP7 Experience will give special focus on the wellbeing of the young changemakers, and how addressing their own health can expand and be part of creating solutions for the wellbeing of their communities and the planet.\n",
      "By joining the programme, participants will:\n",
      "After selecting successful applicants to join YLP7 Experience, the main programme will start by 28th of August and will continue until 30th of October. While participants join as individuals, halfway through the programme, participants will form teams that work together in identifying their challenge area and creating an innovative solution that contributes to the achievements of the SDGs.\n",
      "The programme will consist of a series of interactive and informative virtual workshops that will look like this:\n",
      "These series of workshops will be supported by various Optional Sessions that will give you an opportunity to further expand your interests, focus on a direction you would like to develop, create a space to get to know other participants, and learn more about the YLP Bahrain and regional community.\n",
      "By the end of the YLP7 Experience, the teams will then present their ideas to a judging panel at the SDGs Challenge final event. Three winning teams will proceed to the next stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the three winning teams are selected, they are further supported to develop their capacity and mature their ideas in the Teams Mentorship stage, This will include:\n",
      "Every year, the YLP ends with a regional forum where successful youth participants travel to a hosting Arab country. YLP participants get to meet youth from all around the Arab region, share knowledge, learn from each other’s ideas, and network with other young people, regional social innovation experts and policy leaders, and international development organizations. The format and date of the Regional Forum will be defined at a later time, depending on the COVID-19 situation in the region.\n",
      "\n",

      "=TEXT==================\n",
      "Updated on August 16, 2021\n",
      "About the SEIA Initiative:\n",
      "After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and under the lead of the UN Resident Coordinator and the United Nations Development Programme in Bahrain, the United Nations in Bahrain finalized the “UN COVID-19 socio-economic response and recovery framework for Bahrain”. Soon after the Government sought UNDP’s support to lead a COVID-19 Socio-Economic Impact Assessment (SEIA). The initiative took off as a joint collaboration between UNDP Bahrain and the Bahrain Center for Strategic, International and Energy Studies (Derasat), the most prestigious national think tank in Bahrain.\n",
      "Funded through UNDP’s Rapid Response Facility, a global vertical funding window targeted to COVID-19 response work, the SEIA was set up as a dynamically structured platform implemented through a joint DERASAT-UNDP team of experts, with mutually enforcing products, including surveys, analytical reports, interviews, and roundtable discussions with multiple stakeholders.\n",
      "The main objectives of the SEIA in Bahrain are listed below:\n",
      "SEIA Research Overview:\n",
      "In September, under the umbrella of the SEIA, a national household perceptions survey on COVID-19 was carried out, highlighting migrant workers' and women's economic hardship. The survey targeted migrant workers living in Bahrain, particularly Bangladeshis, who represent the lowest skilled expatriate workers. The results showed with unprecedented clarity how these groups have been hit the hardest economically from the pandemic and the related restrictions and economic contraction.\n",
      "Under the SEIA, the technical team also analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on financial transactions and consumer behavior, the private sector, and mental and physical health. A special thanks to private sector actors who contributed to these studies, including 3BL Associates, Bahrain Airport Company, Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Bahrain Institute of Banking and Finance (BIBF), Bahrain SMEs Society, Central Bank of Bahrain, and KPMG Bahrain. This work would also not have been possible without the technical contributions of UNEP, UNESCO, UNICEF, UN Women, IOM, and WHO, who provided technical support and advice on the quality of surveys and studies carried out under this project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below is a comprehensive list of all products published under the SEIA project in collaboration with Derasat, with links to each individual product. More components of the SEIA are expected to be developed in 2021 covering impact on environment, education, gender, and youth.\n",
      "Watch this space for periodical updates of new products as they are published.\n",
      "Reports Published Under the SEIA Collaboration:\n",
      "This report analyses the socio-economic impacts of Covid-19 on communities in Bahrain, with information gathered from comparatively surveying the opinions of 3,000 individuals in 3 countries (Bahrain, the UK, and the US) on the impact of the pandemic on income, jobs, youth, gender, time utilization, psychology, and support preferences. The survey reached four respondent groups: 700 Bahrainis living in Bahrain, 300 Bangladeshis living in Bahrain, 1,000 members of the UK population living in the UK, and 1,000 members of the US population living in the US.\n",
      "The results of the survey showed that all four groups suffered considerable amounts of self-reported economic distress, with Bahrainis in Bahrain suffering the least amount and Bangladeshis in Bahrain suffering the greatest amount.\n",
      "The survey also showed that all four groups reported considerable changes in their allocation towards non-work tasks: Bangladeshis in Bahrain increased the time they allocated to job search and supplementing their incomes, thus leading to less time allocated to non-work activities. Meanwhile, women in the 25-44 age category across demographic groups allocated significantly more time than their male counterparts to assisting children and the elderly.\n",
      "More details on the survey findings and analysis can be found by viewing the report here.\n",
      "\n",
      "This report examines data on the number and value of financial transactions in the Kingdom of Bahrain, for the period between January 2019 to June 2020, aiming to analyze the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on various aspects of consumer behavior. This includes the pandemic’s effect on overall purchases, purchases per sector, consumer prices, and changes to various payment methods.\n",
      "The analysis showed that the Covid-19 pandemic had significant negative impacts on financial transactions and consumer behavior, as of June 2020. First, retail activity saw a significant decrease during this period, as reflected by point of sale transactions. Second, household consumption was significantly restructured during this time, with a renewed emphasis on consumption that can occur within homes (food, furniture, entertainment, telecommunications) at the expensive of goods and services that occur outside the home (hotels, clothing, travel). Third, residents of Bahrain have shifted away from cash towards contactless mobile payment methods over this period.\n",
      "More details on the above and further findings can be found in the report here.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early November 2020, as part of the SEIA, UNDP Bahrain and Derasat convened a small group of private sector representatives and other experts to discuss the impact of Covid-19 on Bahrain’s private sector. This report presents the major issues discussed during the roundtable and presents a series of recommendations targeting businesses and policymakers.\n",
      "Several key points were made during the discussion, including the positive impacts that the fiscal stimulus and monetary policy had on avoiding a Covid-19 related economic downturn in Bahrain, as well as the long-term implications that this crisis might have on the private sector if proper preparation and planning is not taken. To counter these implications, recommendations surrounding digital transformation, strategic planning post-pandemic, and green growth were discussed.\n",

      "This report examines the effect that Covid-19 and its subsequent confinement has had on people’s lives as well as their physical and mental well-being. The report relied on in-depth interviews with a sample of health professionals and telemedicine users to gather qualitative evidence on the impact of Covid-19 on physical and mental health, on the effectiveness of telemedicine as an alternative strategy for accessing healthcare services in Bahrain during the pandemic, and on how telemedicine practices can be improved in the future.\n",
      "This research report showed that the Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the lives and physical and mental wellbeing of the Bahraini population in several ways, including on their ability to manage their lifestyles, ability to manage their chronic diseases, and on their mental health, particularly for individuals aged 18-45 years old.\n",
      "For more details, you can view the report by clicking here.\n",
      "This report, a joint effort between Derasat, the Bahrain Institute of Public Administration, and UNDP Bahrain, summarizes the main points discussed in a roundtable discussion with Bahraini employees working in the public sector, on the topic of remote work in the Bahraini public sector.\n",
      "The report found several benefits from working from home, among which were reduced time lost in commuting, morning anxiety, unnecessary meetings, and socializing. Gains were also made in general mental wellbeing and productivity, improved and more flexible time management, and adoption of technological solutions that increased staff productivity.\n",

      "In March 2020, March 2020, and subsequently in September 2020 and January 2021, the Central Bank of Bahrain instructed banks operating in the Kingdom of Bahrain to offer Bahraini debtors the opportunity to defer the repayment of loans and, in the first of these three deferral decisions, to do so without incurring any interest. This paper analyses the impact of the first two of these three deferrals on Bahraini households using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data gathered from telephone surveys with over 100 Bahrainis. It also presents recommendations for future decisions.\n",

      "This report, developed with Gulf Future Business, WorkSmart, and Virtual Bahrain, reviews the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on digital solutions in the private sector in Bahrain. A survey was administered too 500+ attendees of Virtual Bahrain, the largest digital event in Bahrain, and follow up focus groups were conducted with 25 decision makers and managers to understand their experience responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n",
      "The results of this research and the full report can be accessed here.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to its sizeable direct effect on public health, the Covid-19 pandemic is also having an impact on a wide array of socioeconomic variables, which in turn are affecting the environment. Many studies of these effects have been conducted either at the global level, or for key economies such as China and the US. However, the Kingdom of Bahrain merits special attention due to its geography (it is a small, arid, densely populated archipelago) and its economic structure (it has a high dependence on hydrocarbons and on tourism). This paper explores the effect that the Covid-19 pandemic is having on the environment in the Kingdom of Bahrain using qualitative data garnered from interviews with 14 experts on the Bahraini environment working in government, the academic sector, the private sector, and the non-profit sector. It also presents policy recommendations in light of these findings.\n",

Young people are among the most vulnerable to these impacts but also hold the key to accelerating action towards greener economies that can tackle the challenges of climate change as well as existing economic and social challenges. Therefore, the YLP9 Theme will delve into Green Economy to empower the youth to achieve the sustainable green economy that consolidates the three sustainable development pillars (Social, Environment, and Economy).\n",

The sessions supported participants in developing their leadership potential, learn how to maximize their impact and provided them with the tools and frameworks they may need to make a successful transition into impactful work.\n",
      "On the first day, UNDP and the National Committee hosted at Brinc Batelco IoT Hub Ms. Maram AlQassimi, “SDGs Teacher” and Mr. Ali AlMajthoob, Associate Director, Middle East Venture Partners. Participants were also provided with an introduction to the Sustainable Development Goals by Maryam Al Sadah, Programme and Communications Analyst at UNDP. On the second day, participants were divided into groups based on the sustainable development objectives that Bahrain has prioritized for 2030 . Each group had a number of participants and two or more social innovators who are actively working in a specific field. The aim of the sessions was to highlight patterns, commonalities and key insights of the discussions on social innovation. \n",
      "The second national activity was a three-day Hackathon that equipped participants with the necessary tools and resources to develop a solution to a challenge their communities were facing. More specifically, participants used the Sustainable Development Goals as a backdrop to their solutions. The Hackathon, led and hosted by partners Brinc Batelco IoT Hub, supported participants in scaling up their initiatives through mentoring and technical expertise.\n",
      "20 participants were separated into four teams based on their skillsets and worked on one idea that had been submitted by a team member. UNDP, the National Committee, Brinc and visiting mentors helped scale up the prototypes over three days through different activities such as team building exercises (robot challenge), sessions on pitching and on finance.\n",
      "By the end of the third day, the four teams presented their ideas to a judging panel that consisted of Ms. Maryam Al Sadah (UNDP), Ms. Leena Al Olaimy (3BL), Ms. Lana AlAttar (GDG Manama), and Ms. Marwa Al Askafi (Brinc). \n",
      "Nabatik, a platform to encourage a greener Bahrain through buying a tree in ‘just four clicks’ won first place. E-Save (an application that will help users keep track of their energy consumption), R Cubed (consumer platform that encourages recycling and reusing ), and Vertical Hydroponics Farm (vertical hydroponics farm that will use the Internet of Things (IoT) to streamline and improve farming/agriculture in Bahrain) coming in second, third, and fourth. As such, one representative from each of the top three teams was given the opportunity to attend the regional forum in Amman in November. \n",
      "YLP Regional Forum\n",
      "The YLP Regional Forum was held in Amman, Jordan from the 11th-14th of November, 2019. Sessions during the forum covered topics such as youth political and civic engagement, innovation, pitching, design thinking, and commitments for the future, as well as well-being and meditation. On the final day, youth participants pitched their ideas to a panel of judges, and took part in an exhibition to showcase their social innovation solutions. \n",
